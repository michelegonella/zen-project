Zen is an undocumented framework for fast web site/service iterations. Used in production under heavy load for years.
Supports a pervasive Jsonish OM, reads/writes/pipelines JSON XML and HTML. Features Spring support and js scripting server side, allowing effective and simple java/js communication. 
A few ANTLR DSLs are used for URI Template roundripping, JSON schema definition and an alternative simpler JSON grammar.
It's architecture is heavily inspired by the popular Apache Cocoon web framework. Persistence hooks for JDBC, Mongo, Hibernate, Solr are avalilable.


In case you wonder ZEN is an acronym for Zoe Enea Nina.
